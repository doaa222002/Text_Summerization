# Text Summerization Project
This project implements an advanced text summarization system utilizing pre-trained word embeddings from the GloVe model. The goal is to automatically generate concise summaries from long text passages while preserving key information.

The process begins with thorough preprocessing of the data, which includes steps like removing stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant characters. This ensures that the model focuses on the most meaningful terms within the text. The GloVe embeddings are then used to capture the semantic relationships between words, allowing the model to create summaries that retain the essence of the original content.

The result is an efficient and effective text summarization system capable of condensing lengthy documents into shorter, coherent summaries, making it a powerful tool for information retrieval, content generation, and knowledge extraction across various applications.
